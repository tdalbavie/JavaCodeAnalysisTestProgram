# JavaCodeAnalysisTestProgram
A test program that is used to test the [JavaCodeAnalysis](https://github.com/tdalbavie/JavaCodeAnalysis) program to ensure all counts are functioning as intended. This project does not have any functionality other than to provide all possible instances of when a count may happen. Run the [JavaCodeAnalysis](https://github.com/tdalbavie/JavaCodeAnalysis) program with this test program and compare the total counts with the results below. The number total for all counts should be the same.
